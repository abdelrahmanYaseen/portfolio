                        The broker is responsible from opening, closing trades, and keeping track of stop-loss, take-profit signals.
                    </li>
                    <li style={{'margin-left':'5px'}} ><b>Trader</b> The trader has a access to the historical data provided by the market, and is capable of defining a <i>strategy</i>
                    that triggers opening/closing long/short positions given the status of the market.

                </ul>
                <p>At the end of the simulation, statistics about the win/loss rates, fees and more are presented.</p>

                pushing or jumping on top of them. Initially, you have lots of fur to shoot, 
                but then you become lighter as you make fur balls and throw them, 
                meaning that you can jump and move faster but youâ€™re easily pushed.</p>

                The game is fast and dynamic, you need to constantly jump and move to avoid being hit,

                There are different strategies, each one with pros and cons,  
                will you shoot a lot to become lighter and faster or will you prefer being heavy,
